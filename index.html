  <h1>The Art of Designing With Heart</h1>
  <h2>How to make useful, friendly software for real people.</h2>
<p>
One of the things I love about making software is that it’s a deeply mental exercise, chock full of heady processes, abstractions, and interconnected pathways.
</p>

<p>
You can fill your brain with the practical nuts and bolts side of it—research, strategy, prototyping, programming, UI, operations, and more. Lots more.
    </p>
  <p>
And if that’s not enough? Indulge yourself in metrics and performance. Every last detail can be tested, quantified and optimized to the fullest. Get high on KPIs and keep your eyes on your ROI!
    </p>
    <p>
The problem is…with so much to think about, and so many logistics to obsess over, it’s easy to forget the reason you’re doing any of this in the first place:
    </p>
<h1>🚨️ YOUR SOFTWARE EXISTS TO HELP PEOPLE! 🚨 </h1>
    <p>
Designers usually call this notion User Experience or Empathy. I think those names stink. They’re buzzwordy and vague enough to mean different things in different contexts.
    </p>
      <p>
        I think we should call it what it really is: <b><i>Designing With Heart</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
This isn’t something that’s the responsibility of one specific team in your company, or one step in a process that you can check off. It’s a core value that informs every decision you make.
    </p>
      <p>
Here’s what that means in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
At the other end of all your strategy and metrics and tech, there are real people. Living, breathing people — who are busy dealing with their weird life, arguing with their kids, trying to figure out what’s for dinner.
    </p>
      <p>
When you build software, you’re painstakingly inventing a machine that stands in your place, feigns sentience, and interacts with these people on your behalf so they can accomplish something meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
Your software is not just a bunch of code and UI you smushed together. It’s also a compilation of your best ideas, your best intentions, your desire to help others, your compassion, your feelings, your soul.
    </p>
    <p>Your software is YOU.</p>
    <p>
(That is, if you believe in the art of it. And you should, if you give a damn about doing it right.)
    </p>
    <p>
When you see things in this light, you’ll notice that a lot of software is dull and lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
Consider your bank’s website, or your insurance company’s billing system. They’re probably cold and impersonal. That’s because the designers treated their job as a mechanical sequence: they took a set of requirements, invented imaginary personas, wrote user stories, and sprinted their way through the work until the requirements were met. All head, no heart.

    <p>
Now, you might think it’s fine for a bank site to be plain and transactional. After all, banking is <i>literally a set of transactions</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
But compare that to the experience you’d have with a nice bank teller (if you can still remember what that was like.) The teller smiles at you, asks how your day is going, double-checks that your math is right, offers to help with something you might have forgotten, and gives you a lollipop! 🍭
      <p/>
    <p>That’s a transaction with a bit of heart.</p>
